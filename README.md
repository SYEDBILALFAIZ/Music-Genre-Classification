🎵 Music Genre Classification

This project focuses on classifying songs into different genres using the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle. It combines audio signal processing with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to achieve accurate multi-class classification.

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Loaded GTZAN dataset

Converted audio files into structured numerical form

Feature Extraction

Extracted MFCCs, Spectrograms, Chroma features using Librosa

Normalized and prepared data for modeling

Model Training

Implemented ML models: SVM, Random Forest, KNN

Trained CNN with Keras for deep learning approach

Model Evaluation

Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Compared ML vs DL performance
